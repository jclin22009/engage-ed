# EngagEd

EngagEd is a website intended to allow any person to teach whatever they'd like in a highly customizable way, and let learners access lessons on a wide plethora of content. It contains a simplified webpage creator meant to let educators easily customize their own webpage for classes; the creator contains a text editor based off standard word processors, and comes with education-tailored functions, such as adding short answer and multiple-choice questions. Prospective students can use the "Browse Courses" page to look through courses and their instructors.

EngagEd is built with Express.js and Node.js.
