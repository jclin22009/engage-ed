EngagEd is a website that allows any person to teach whatever they'd like in a highly customizable way, and lets learners access lessons on a wide variety of content. It contains a simplified webpage creator that lets educators easily customize their own lessons; the creator features a UI similar to modern word processors, and comes with education-tailored functions like adding quiz questions. Learners can browse all lessons on the platform.

EngagEd is built with Express.js and Node.js.
